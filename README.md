You are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 7<sup>2</sup> is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-35)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.
